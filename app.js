   * Your app should include a render() function, that regenerates the view each time the store is updated. 
   * See your course material and access support for more details.
   *
   * NO additional HTML elements should be added to the index.html file.
   *
   * You may add attributes (classes, ids, etc) to the existing HTML elements, or link stylesheets or additional scripts if necessary
